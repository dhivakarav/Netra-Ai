# NetraAI – Non-Line-of-Sight Presence Intelligence System 

NetraAI is an AI-powered system designed to detect human presence even without direct line-of-sight using intelligent signal processing and machine learning techniques.

---

## Problem Statement
      
Traditional vision-based systems require direct visibility to detect human presence.  
NetraAI aims to detect presence even when the subject is hidden behind walls or obstacles using intelligent signal interpretation.
